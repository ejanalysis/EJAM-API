# EJAM-API
In February 2025, USEPA removed its EJSCREEN website from public access, including an API for querying EJSCREEN indices/indicators and Census data. One of the main features of the API was geographically-based inquiries. It could be used to, for instance, return EJSCREEN and Census metrics weighted based on the Census Blocks within a 3 mile buffer around a selected point. The API facilitated the creation of [community reports](https://www.sf.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/EJScreen%20Community%20Report.pdf) based on those kinds of queries. 

Recreating that API would require extensive reverse engineering of the ArcGIS map server(s) that hosted the API functionality. Instead, our approach is to draw on [EJAM](https://github.com/ejanalysis/EJAM), the non-EPA version of an open-source R package that provides EJSCREEN's "multisite" reporting feature. EJAM was designed to produce EJSCREEN-style community reports, including single-site reports and multisite reports (summaries over multiple locations). The EJAM package itself does not currently provide an API; this repo contains files necessary to create a Docker image of EJAM and its dependencies as well as an API model.

# Model
There are currently two endpoints for the API.

## Reports
`report` accepts GET requests with the following parameters:
- `lat` - the latitude of a given point, or comma-separated list like lat=33,32.5
- `lon` - the longitude
- `fips` - A FIPS code for a specific US Census geography, like fips=10 for one state, or comma-separated list like fips=10001,10003,10005 for 3 counties
- `shape` - a GeoJSON text-encoded object describing an area of interest, such as a polygon of neighborhood boundaries
- `buffer` - radius, in miles, around a point or out from the edge of a polygon to extend the search. EJAM default = 3. *Note: adding buffers around fips units may not be implemented yet.

`report` expects either `lat`/`lon` OR `shape` OR `fips`. The default buffer around a point is 3 miles but can be explicitly set to 0.
An HTML format of a report is returned.

### Examples
A County: https://ejamapi-84652557241.us-central1.run.app/report?buffer=1&fips=10001

A point in the Phoenix area with a 4 mile buffer (radius): https://ejamapi-84652557241.us-central1.run.app/report?lat=33&lon=-112&buffer=4

A rectangular area of interest in Phoenix, with no buffer: https://ejamapi-84652557241.us-central1.run.app/report?shape=%7B"type"%3A"FeatureCollection"%2C"features"%3A%5B%7B"type"%3A"Feature"%2C"properties"%3A%7B%7D%2C"geometry"%3A%7B"coordinates"%3A%5B%5B%5B-112.01991856401462%2C33.51124624304089%5D%2C%5B-112.01991856401462%2C33.47010908826502%5D%2C%5B-111.95488826248605%2C33.47010908826502%5D%2C%5B-111.95488826248605%2C33.51124624304089%5D%2C%5B-112.01991856401462%2C33.51124624304089%5D%5D%5D%2C"type"%3A"Polygon"%7D%7D%5D%7D&buffer=0

## Data
`data` accepts POST requests with the following parameters:
- `sites` - a list of lat/lon pairs e.g. `[{"lat":33, "lon":-112}, {"lat":34, "lon":-114}]`
- `shape` - a GeoJSON object describing an area of interest, such as a polygon of neighborhood boundaries
- `buffer` - radius, in miles, around the center of a point or out from the edge of a polygon to extend the search. Default = 0
- `fips` - A FIPS code for a specific US Census geography (e.g. 10001)
- `scale` - For FIPS requests, the unit of at which to return results (county or blockgroup)
- `geometries` - A boolean to indicate whether to return a geometry field for each analyzed unit. Default = FALSE

`data` expects either `sites` OR `shape` OR `fips`. 
A JSON object of EJAM output is returned.

### Examples
```
# Queries
import json
with open('houston_zips.json', 'r') as f:
  houston_zips = json.load(f)
data = {"buffer":0,"shape":json.dumps(houston_zips)} # Using a previously loaded GeoJSON of zipcodes in Houston
data = {"buffer": 1, "shape": json.dumps(simple_shape), "geometries": True} # Using a previously loaded simple GeoJSON feature, and returning its geometry
data = {"buffer": 4, "sites": [{"lat":33, "lon":-112}]} # A single set of coordinates
data = {"buffer": 4, "sites": [{"lat":33, "lon":-112}, {"lat":34, "lon":-114}]} # Two or more sets of coordinates
data = {"buffer": 0, "fips": ["482012301001","482012302002", "482012302003"], "scale":"blockgroup"} # Four blockgroups
data = {"buffer": 0, "fips": "DE", "scale": "blockgroup"} # One state, returning results at the blockgroup level
data = {"buffer": 0, "fips": "DE", "scale": "county"} # One state with county level results
data = {"buffer": 0, "fips": ["DE", "RI"], "scale": "county"} # Two states, county level results

# Execute data query
import requests
url = "https://ejamapi-84652557241.us-central1.run.app/data"
response = requests.post(url, json=data)

# Load response as Pandas dataframe
df = pandas.DataFrame.from_dict(response.json())
df
```

# Set-up
1. Work locally with EJAM by installing R/RStudio. Follow the [installation instructions](https://ejanalysis.github.io/EJAM/articles/installing.html) in the [EJAM documentation](https://ejanalysis.org/ejamdocs).
2. Test changes to the API (i.e. modify `rest_controller.r`)
3. Re-build and tag the Docker image
4. Push to Docker Hub and/or Google Artifact Registry
5. Re-deploy in Google Cloud Run
